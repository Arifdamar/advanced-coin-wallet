## Advanced Coin Wallet for Sakarya University Computer Science Final Project

This project allows you to track different crypto assets from different exchanges (Binance and KuCoin for now).

You can register securely from the registration page. After that, the app will take you to the Home Page. Once logged in, you can start adding the crypto assets you want to track to your portfolio.

We don't access your wallets so you can trust and follow your assets freely.

You can also see the time-dependent change chart of your portfolio in this application.
